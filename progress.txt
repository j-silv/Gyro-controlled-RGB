OBJECTIVE:

RTOS that reads FPGA accelerometer values via SPI, saves these values via DMA,
and prints values via USART to serial terminal. main() processes accelerometer values, and
depending on the rate of acceleration, the luminosity of onboard LEDs (PWM duty cycle)
increase/decrease accordingly. For example, if there is a large acceleration in the X direction
the LED will become brighter.

MILESTONES:

**Complete**

-Configure GPIO and blink an LED
-Configure USART and blink an LED and send LED ON/OFF messages to serial terminal
-Blink an LED with interrupt, send via USART LED ON/OFF messages with SYSTICK interrupt

**In progress**

-Configure SPI peripheral
-Communicate via SPI with accelerometer on BeMicro MAX 10 Dev Kit
-Accelerometer peripheral with interrupt
-Send accelerometer values via USART with SPI interrupt
-Setup PWM signal to control GPIO pin LED luminosity
-RTOS to control various tasks
