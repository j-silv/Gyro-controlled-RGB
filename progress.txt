OBJECTIVE:

A gyroscope controlled RGB cube, where rotations along (x, y, z) axis correspond
to intensity value changes for a red, green, and blue LED

DETAILS:

RTOS that reads IMU values via SPI, saves these values via DMA.
Values are processed to obtain angle information, transformed into R, G, B values and sent 
via USART to serial terminal. Depending on the angle of rotation along a particular axis, 
the luminosity of the R, G, or B LED will increase/decrease (PWM duty cycle)

MILESTONES:

**Complete**

-Configure GPIO and blink an LED
-Configure USART and blink an LED and send LED ON/OFF messages to serial terminal
-Blink an LED with interrupt, send via USART LED ON/OFF messages with SYSTICK interrupt
-Configure SPI peripheral

**In progress**

-Create schematic detailing pin connections between STM32 uC, FPGA dev kit, and headers inbetween
-Configure SPI for DMA
-Write accelerometer driver
-Communicate via SPI with accelerometer on BeMicro MAX 10 Dev Kit
-Accelerometer peripheral with interrupt
-Send accelerometer values via USART with SPI interrupt
-Setup PWM signal to control GPIO pin LED luminosity
-RTOS to control various tasks
