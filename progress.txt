To help track my progress on this project, there are certain milestones I would like
to achieve along the way.

My ultimate goal is to:

-Have an RTOS that reads accelerometer values via SPI, saves these values via DMA,
and prints values via USART to serial terminal

Here are some steps along the way:

1) Configure GPIO and blink an LED
2) Configure USART and blink an LED and send LED ON/OFF messages to serial terminal
3) Blink an LED with interrupt, send LED ON/OFF messages with interrupt
4) Use an RTOS to blink and LED and send LED ON/OFF messages
5) Configure SPI peripheral
6) Communicate via SPI with accelerometer on BeMicro MAX 10 Dev Kit
7) Accelerometer peripheral with interrupt
8) Send accelerometer values to USART with interrupt
