OBJECTIVE:

Have an RTOS that reads FPGA accelerometer values via SPI line, saves these values via DMA,
and prints values via USART to serial terminal. main() processes accelerometer values.

MILESTONES:

**Complete**

-Configure GPIO and blink an LED
-Configure USART and blink an LED and send LED ON/OFF messages to serial terminal
-Blink an LED with interrupt, send via USART LED ON/OFF messages with SYSTICK interrupt

**In progress**

-Configure SPI peripheral
-Communicate via SPI with accelerometer on BeMicro MAX 10 Dev Kit
-Accelerometer peripheral with interrupt
-Send accelerometer values via USART with SPI interrupt 
-Use an RTOS to blink LED and send LED ON/OFF messages
